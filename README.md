# 📊 Task 4 – Aggregate Functions and Grouping

## 📘 Overview
This task focuses on learning how to *summarize and analyze* data using SQL's aggregate functions such as SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), and MAX(), along with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. These are essential tools for generating insights from large datasets.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- *SQLiteStudio
- *GitHub* for version control and submission


## 🧪 What I Did

### ✅ Key SQL Operations Performed
| Query Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| COUNT() | Counted users, orders, and non-null emails |
| SUM() | Total order amounts and product quantities |
| AVG() | Calculated average prices and spend per user |
| MIN() / MAX() | Found lowest and highest product prices per category |
| ROUND() | Rounded off average prices for readability |
| GROUP BY | Grouped data by user, product, category, and order |
| HAVING | Filtered grouped results (e.g., total quantity > 1) |
| JOIN | Joined tables for cross-table aggregation (e.g., Orders + Users) |
| DISTINCT | Counted unique users who placed orders |


## 📂 Files Included
- task4.sql – Contains all SQL queries for the task
- README.md – Documentation of what the task included and what was done


## 🧠 Sample Queries
- Total number of users and orders
- Average price of products
- Revenue per order using JOIN
- Total amount spent by each user
- Count of distinct ordering users
- Products with quantity ordered > 1 using HAVING

## 🏁 Conclusion
This task helped me understand how to *analyze and group* tabular data effectively using SQL aggregate functions. These skills are crucial for real-world analytics, reporting, and dashboard creation in any data-driven application.
